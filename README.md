# Social-Computing
This repo contains my two studies on box office prediction using social computing. Overall, I believe this is a field with great potential that has not been fully explored yet. With the development of large language models, it has become possible to conduct research on a larger scale of language data. From both business and computer science perspectives, I see this as a valuable area of study.
